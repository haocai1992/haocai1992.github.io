Hello! My name is Hao Cai.

I am a computational biologist in Toronto, working at the intersection of data science and biology. My current focus is to apply machine learning in the understanding of an important biological process (["biomolecular condensation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomolecular_condensate#:~:text=Biomolecular%20condensates%20are%20a%20class,controlled%20by%20a%20bounding%20membrane.)) that underlies many cellular functions and neurological diseases.

My background is biophysics. I completed PhD at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, where I studied a protein family called DgHBP, which forms a remarkable material in nature -- [the beak of jumbo squid](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ali.miserez/Nonmineral.html). I was fascinated by how sophisticated the protein encodings are controlling their behaviours, and therefore moved from lab work to coding.

Aside from science, Iâ€™m also interested in the business world. As a former student entrepreneur, I kept a close eye on many industries (e-commmerce, healthcare, education, ...) and new startups, and I am using my data science skills to conduct several industry analysis projects, which you can find in this blog.
